Installation:
Unzip the zipfile and place it somewhere that makes sense.
In your extensions dropdown, click "Manage Extensions".
If you're installing from the release section of this repo, you may need to activate "Developer Mode".
Click the button "Load Unpacked".
Navigate to the folder you unzipped it to, and click "Select Folder".
Installation done.

Sniff saves the links it detects as cookies, and as some browser settings vary, the links it displays may "stick" in the viewport for a while. As a response to this, you can clear the cookies for the session by clicking "Reload Plugin". This button is also handy if for some rare reason the plugin glitches.
